![Epita](https://operator-front-static-cdn.winamax.fr/img/editorial/2021/11/23/epita2.jpg)


## Introduction

This project is a visualization tool for various algorithms implemented in Rust, utilizing the GTK toolkit for the graphical user interface. The aim is to provide an interactive platform for users to observe and understand how different algorithms work.

## Features

- Visualization of various algorithms.
- Interactive GUI powered by GTK for user-friendly experience.
- Customizable parameters for algorithms.
- Step-by-step visualization updates.


## Requirements for users

- GTK development libraries and dependencies (for Linux)
- Dot command from GraphViz (mandatory) (https://graphviz.org/download/)
